# add_reminder
Add a reminder through Alfred 4 to Apple's Reminders.app

See a detailed explanation on: https://www.codetactics.de/2020/05/add-a-reminder-to-reminders-app/

The workflow is triggered by the keyword "r" and processes some natural dates.
I currently leave the date in the reminder. But it can be parsed out later.

The source is also as a separate file in the repo to easily have a first look or validate.

Example usage:
- r do laundy
- r go to the gym next week
- r do more work in 2 days

Code inspired by https://michaelkummer.com/tech/apple/reminders-shortcut/ and https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/917-reminders/
